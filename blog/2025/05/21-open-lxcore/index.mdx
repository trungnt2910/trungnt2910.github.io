Microsoft recently announced the first [open source](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/05/19/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-is-now-open-source/)
[release](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/commit/697572d664c9371abbc53cab9cf7b4b32be1980e) of the
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

This has sparked great enthusiasm in the community, especially regular WSL2 users or those
interested in the user-mode components facilitating Windows/Linux interop. However, long-term
WSL enthusiasts will notice one major missing component: `lxcore.sys`.

This post explores why we don't have LxCore (yet), why we **should**, and what Microsoft can do.

## What is LxCore

LxCore (`lxcore.sys`) is the core kernel-mode component of WSL.

It is a
"[Pico provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/wsl/pico-process-overview#pico-processes-and-providers)" -
a kernel-mode driver that powers WSL1 "Pico processes". LxCore is responsible for creating these
special processes, setting up the runtime environment, and handling "system calls" made by Linux
user-mode binaries.

LxCore also hosts the LXSS interop device (`\Device\LXSS`), which plays a vital role in
Windows/Linux interop, even for the VM-based WSL2 architecture.

## Why is it left behind

### It's not in the repo

The [official announcement](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2025/05/19/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-is-now-open-source/)
from the Windows team says:

> The following components are still part of the Windows image and are not open sourced at this time:
> - Lxcore.sys, the kernel side driver that powers WSL 1
> - P9rdr.sys and p9np.dll, which runs the “\\wsl.localhost” filesystem redirection (from Windows to Linux)

Since the Windows 10 era, Microsoft has had a trend of moving core Windows components to separate
packages on the Microsoft Store to allow more flexible release cycles - updates can be delivered
independent from Windows feature releases.

These components become separate repositories, some of which get open-sourced, such as the
[Calculator](https://github.com/microsoft/calculator) or the
[Console/Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal).

The same happened to WSL in
[2021](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/commit/697572d664c9371abbc53cab9cf7b4b32be1980e). The
codebase got separated, and after some time, the package got published to the Microsoft Store.
However, this package
[did not include WSL1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-in-the-microsoft-store-is-now-generally-available-on-windows-10-and-11/#what-this-means-for-wsl-1-and-the-in-windows-version-of-wsl):

> Support for running WSL 1 distros still requires the “Windows Subsystem for Linux” optional component.

This move is understandable - while Windows usermode binaries (such as `wsl.exe`) can become shims
pointing to Microsoft Store packages (just like what `calc.exe` does), drivers, especially ones
loaded on early boot, have to be in the Windows system directory.

So, `lxcore.sys` (and other kernel components) is... simply not there and is highly unlikely to be
moved to that repo.

### It's not buildable (yet)

`lxcore.sys` is based on the private Pico processes API declared in `ntosp.h`
(probably "NT OS Private header"). To build `lxmonika`, a project that relies on the similar API,
a lot of reverse engineering of
[private structures](https://github.com/trungnt2910/lxmonika/blob/master/lxmonika/include/pico.h)
have to be done.

Pico processes are just a start. After that is how to handle processes, threads, memory, input,
and so on. Each of this area opens a whole new field of undocumented interfaces, such as threads
and signals implemented using [APCs](https://repnz.github.io/posts/apc/kernel-user-apc-api/) or
console I/O made through an
[undocumented ConDrv device](https://github.com/trungnt2910/lxmonika/blob/e981eb77535b3fccb23322ae15bf6f1a82830100/lxmonika/src/condrv.cpp#L89).

### It's impossible to install
... at least, not without fragile hacks.

Pico processes are available to only an elite few: the so-called "Core" drivers, determined by a
hard-coded list in `winload`, `OslCoreDriverServices`. Among the lucky drivers are `lxss.sys`, which
has a hard dependency on `lxcore.sys` and is responsible for bootstrapping the latter.

To install a home-grown LxCore, replacing the original `lxcore.sys` is necessary. We can also
replace one of the core drivers, which is what `lxmonika`
[does](https://github.com/trungnt2910/lxmonika/blob/e981eb77535b3fccb23322ae15bf6f1a82830100/monika/src/Commands/Install.cpp#L26).

If anything goes wrong during boot, or if a Windows Update messes something up, the system will get
stuck in a bootloop.

### It's risky

In the early days of WSL, `lxcore.sys` was the frequent cause of BSoDs and targets for exploits.
This is expected for a highly privileged driver rapidly growing in complex features.

While the BSoDs have virtually disappeared in the 2020s, the complexity of the driver makes it hard
to guarantee that no more exploits exist and that none can fall into the wrong hands as the source
for this huge attack surface gets laid bare to the public.

## Why we should still have it

It is entirely fine to have the core driver kept out of the Microsoft Store package and open-sourced
outside of the main repo. Since there is no longer active development, commits and releases are not
of concern.

It is entirely fine if nobody could build and install the code when released. Microsoft can choose
not to provide any support, and experts and enthusiasts can
[quickly fill in the gaps](https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/index.htm?tx=158).

It is (probably?) fine to have the source for LxCore publicly audited. With the feature set frozen
for nearly a decade, the driver should now be much more mature. Furthermore, with the wider adoption
of WSL2 and the WSL Store package, LxCore should mostly be disabled by default, minimizing the
impact of vulnerabilities.

Such a technical marvel as WSL1 can open up a wide range of research topics and have various
potential applications in the field of operating systems and optimizing compatibility layers. It
would be a waste for the WSL1 codebase to stay in Microsoft's drawers for years collecting dust.
Opening up this gem to the community will breathe in new life for the years of work and probably
thousands of commits by dozens of team members.

## What can Microsoft do

I suggest dumping the WSL1 "reference source", similar to what has been done with the
[.NET Framework BCL](https://github.com/microsoft/referencesource). This repo can be read-only,
have no build support, contain no version history - just the source code.

From there, we - the community of enthusiasts - can carry on this project, something that Microsoft
has [abandoned since 2019](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/4022).

This would also not be the first time Microsoft releases the reference source code for a built-in
Windows driver. [`NetAdapterCx.sys`](https://github.com/microsoft/Network-Adapter-Class-Extension/)
is already up there, in the same "reference source" style.

## What's next for `lxmonika`

While I have
[previously stated](https://github.com/trungnt2910/lxmonika/discussions/5#discussioncomment-11131893)
that `lxmonika` will not be a drop-in replacement for WSL1, there is a lot to learn from WSL1's
architecture. The recent source and [documentation](https://wsl.dev) release makes this learning
easier than ever.

A potential `lxcore.sys` source code can allow an "enhanced" LxCore running as a `lxmonika.sys`
provider. The provider can be patched to allow hosting
[User Mode Linux](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/1692), acting as a temporary
implementation as more research being done done on Lilyx - a provider based on the full Linux
kernel.

## Acknowledgements

Thanks to the **50+ people** from [Project Reality](https://reality.trungnt2910.com/discord) and the
wider community for supporting me and my
[discussion](https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/discussions/12922) on the WSL repo. In under 24 hours,
this has become the top 3 most upvoted discussions of all time there.

Thanks to Microsoft and everyone in the open-source community for the recent source release. While
it did not contain what I really desire, it gave me the enthusiasm for writing this post after
more than half a year of silence.
