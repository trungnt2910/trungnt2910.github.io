So, recently I have been doing quite a lot of esoteric stuff, uncovering quite a few internal
details of Windows and other software.

Weird as these things may seem, they may be invaluable for those intending to embark on a low-level
programming adventure.

Because of this, and following the relative success of my
[".NET Developer Platform"](https://www.haiku-os.org/blog/trungnt2910) series on the Haiku OS
website, I decided to start a personal blog. The first few posts will mostly be about
[`lxmonika`](https://github.com/trungnt2910/lxmonika) - a framework for porting other OS kernels
to Windows, but I will, of course, write about other general tips and hacks whenever I encounter
them.

This blog will be multilingual, featuring:
- English (as in most other online publications),
- Vietnamese (don't wanna widen the gap between quality English and Vietnamese materials),
- and Japanese (I'm still practicing though, so Japanese translations might be way behind).

Thanks for visiting my site, and happy coding!
